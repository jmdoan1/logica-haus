<h2 style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Background</h2>

In 2012, I graduated from college with a bachelor's degree in accounting. Accounting was kind of a random choice after I squandered my first to years on the PR track. When it came time to pick a new track, my mom was adamant about choosing something in "business", as "that's where the money is most consistent". While it was a random decision, I actually kind of liked it, as my brain had was very logically and mathematically inclined and I grew up with an almost morbid curiosity about how businesses worked under the hood. I even originally picked PR due to my childhood curiosity about what how businesses talked a certain way to be interpreted by the masses to mean one thing while being able to legally claim they menat another.

I did actually find accounting to be very conceptually interesting. Being an accountant requires understanding every aspect of the business you work for, being one of the few people entrusted with almost every available piece of data, and this was at least enough. However, after entering the actual workforce, I quickly learned I was not built for the career in question. To this day, I can guarantee you that no matter how taxic your most toxic job was, the accounting department had it worse.

Unless you're working at an accounting firm, the accounting department is one of the only non-revenue-generating departments in any company. This means zero consideration given when it comes to quality tooling, quality of life, or basically anything that doesn't lead to getting reports ready for shareholders, and they don't care how uncooperative the other departments are at helping you gather accurite information, as that's really just a distraction from the actual bottom line. The departments are full of elitists who care about nothing more than title and are not afraid to use others as a step on the ladder to CPA->manager->controller->VP->CFO. You are also beholden to KPIs that have to improve every quarter, meaning the only thing you can do is the same thing you've done but faster and faster, as there is no room innovation in accounting. Every innovative accountant you know is a criminal that was a Netflix documentary about said innovation. This means your only choice is to work yourself to the point of burnout and then burn yourself even further every quarter and working anything under a 60-80 hour week is considered lack of commitment. And that's just an average week, don't even ask about "close periods", i.e. the period of time between when a month/quarter ends and the books have to be closed for reporting.

This was not a game I was willing to play, and I spent most of my jobs immediately figuring out the least work I could do to leave the office at 5pm without getting fired (spoiler alert: I got fired a lot).
